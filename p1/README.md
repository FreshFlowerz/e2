## Game planning
+ Create an array, with three elements; Rock, paper, scissors
+ For Player A choose a random element from the rock,paper,scissors array
+ For Player B choose a random element from the rock,paper,scissors array
+ Compare the Player A moves to Player B - if its a match,its a "Tie"
+ Otherwise, 
    - Rock beats Scissors, 
    - Scissors beats Paper, 
    - Paper beats Rock.
+ In the view, report the results - player a's move, player b's move, the flip, the winner

## Notes for instructor
I tried to challenge myself to try and go for the wargame, but realized i wouldnt have enough time to get it done. I really liked this project and wanted to create the Spades game but that also started to have its challneges. I wanted to impress you after being late but realized its best i just get you the MVP items  rather than mess up trying to bite off more than i can chew. I will say this game was pretty easy for me to get done so i wish i had more time to challenge myself. I got stuck on how i would get a running count of the rounds and dispplay the total.
