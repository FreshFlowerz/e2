    - Rock beats Scissors, 
    - Scissors beats Paper, 
    - Paper beats Rock.

## Notes for instructor
I tried to challenge myself to try and go for the wargame, but realized i wouldnt have enough time to get it done. I really liked this project and wanted to create the card game called Spades. However, that games also has its challenges. I wanted to impress you after being late but realized its best I just get you the MVP items  rather than mess up trying to bite off more than I can chew. I will say this game was pretty easy for me to get done so I wish I had more time to challenge myself. I got stuck on how I would get a running count of the rounds and display the total. I know I wanted the winner result of each round, but then i needed to get a running count for each winner. It sounds simple but had trouble coding it. Thank you for your understanding.
